    This function provides the easiest way to create an unsigned transaction.

    All coin values are in satoshis.

    :param spendables: a list of Spendable objects, which act as inputs.
        Each item in the list can be a Spendable, or text from Spendable.as_text,
        or a dictionary from Spendable.as_dict (which might be easier for
        airgapped transactions, for example).
    :param payables: a list where each entry is a address, or a tuple of
        (address, coin_value). If the coin_value is missing or
        zero, this address is thrown into the "split pool". Funds not
        explicitly claimed by the fee or an address are shared as
        equally as possible among the split pool. All coins are consumed:
        if the amount to be split does not divide evenly, some of the earlier
        addresses will get an extra satoshi.
    :param fee: an integer, or the (deprecated) string "standard" for it to be calculated
    :param version: (optional) the version to use in the transaction. Defaults to 1.
    :param lock_time: (optional) the lock_time to use in the transaction. Defaults to 0.
